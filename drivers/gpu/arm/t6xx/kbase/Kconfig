	default n
	help
	  When you start to work with the Mali-T600 Series device driver the platform-specific code of
	  the Linux kernel for your platform may not be complete. In this situation the kernel device driver
	  supports creating the platform device outside of the Linux platform-specific code.
	  Enable this option if would like to use a platform device configuration from within the device driver.
