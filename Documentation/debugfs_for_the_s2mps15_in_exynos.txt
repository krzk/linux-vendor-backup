Gyeongtaek Lee (gt82.lee@samsung.com)

1. What it does?
This debug file system shows the power down configuration of the S2MPS15 pmic.

2. Definitions
(1) Mode
There is three modes.
- ON: Regulator is always on.
- SUSPEND: Regulator is off during sleep.

3. How to use

3.1. Enable the debug fs for the PMIC.
(1) Enable debug fs configuration.
$ make menuconfig --> Kernel hacking --> Debug Filesystem
(2) Build and download the kernel.

3.2. Viewing the configurations at a look
(1) Turn the device on and access the terminal.
(2) Change directory to debug fs for the PMIC.
$ cd /sys/kernel/debug/s2mps15
(3) Cat mode.
$ cat mode
NAME    MODE
====================
BUCK1   SUSPEND
BUCK2   SUSPEND
BUCK3   SUSPEND
......

3.3. Viewing the each configuration
(1) Turn the device on and access the terminal.
(2) Change directory to debug fs for the PMIC.
$ cd /sys/kernel/debug/s2mps15
(3) Change directory to specific regulator
$ cd /LDO1
(4) Cat mode
$ cat mode
NORMAL

3.4. Changing the power down configuration
(1) Turn the device on and access the terminal.
(2) Change directory to debug fs.
$ cd /sys/kernel/debug/s2mps15
(3) Change directory to specific regulator
$ cd LDO34
(3) Echo new mode and verify it.
# echo "on" > mode
# cat mode
ON

4. What should be done after?

4.1 Modify the mode table.
Modify regulator-initial-mode of each regulator on dts file.
Ex. To make buck1 to always on, change regulator-initial-mode of
hsi2c@13660000->s2mps15_pmic@66->regulators->buck1_reg: BUCK1 to 3.
