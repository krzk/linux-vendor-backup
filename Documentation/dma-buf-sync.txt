This document is a guide for device-driver writers describing the DMA buffer
synchronization API. This document also describes how to use the API to
use buffer synchronization mechanism between DMA and DMA, CPU and DMA, and
CPU and CPU.

The DMA Buffer synchronization API provides buffer synchronization mechanism;
i.e., buffer access control to CPU and DMA, and easy-to-use interfaces for
device drivers and user application. And this API can be used for all dma
devices using system memory as dma buffer, especially for most ARM based SoCs.


Motivation
----------

Buffer synchronization issue between DMA and DMA:
	Sharing a buffer, a device cannot be aware of when the other device
	will access the shared buffer: a device may access a buffer containing
	wrong data if the device accesses the shared buffer while another
	device is still accessing the shared buffer.
	Therefore, a user process should have waited for the completion of DMA
	access by another device before a device tries to access the shared
	buffer.

Buffer synchronization issue between CPU and DMA:
	A user process should consider that when having to send a buffer, filled
	by CPU, to a device driver for the device driver to access the buffer as
	a input buffer while CPU and DMA are sharing the buffer.
	This means that the user process needs to understand how the device
	driver is worked. Hence, the conventional mechanism not only makes
	user application complicated but also incurs performance overhead.

Buffer synchronization issue between CPU and CPU:
	In case that two processes share one buffer; shared with DMA also,
	they may need some mechanism to allow process B to access the shared
	buffer after the completion of CPU access by process A.
	Therefore, process B should have waited for the completion of CPU access
	by process A using the mechanism before trying to access the shared
	buffer.

What is the best way to solve these buffer synchronization issues?
	We may need a common object that a device driver and a user process
	notify the common object of when they try to access a shared buffer.
	That way we could decide when we have to allow or not to allow for CPU
	or DMA to access the shared buffer through the common object.
	If so, what could become the common object? Right, that's a dma-buf[1].
	Now we have already been using the dma-buf to share one buffer with
	other drivers.

How we can utilize multi threads for more performance?
	DMA and CPU works individually. So CPU could perform other works while
	DMA are performing some works, and vise versa.
	However, in the conventional way, that is not easy to do so because
	DMA operation is depend on CPU operation, and vice versa.

	Conventional way:
        User                                     Kernel
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        CPU writes something to src
        send the src to driver------------------------->
                                                 update DMA register
        request DMA start(1)--------------------------->
                                                 DMA start
                <---------completion signal(2)----------
        CPU accesses dst

        (1) Request DMA start after the CPU access to src buffer is completed.
        (2) Access dst buffer after DMA access to the dst buffer is completed.

On the other hand, if there is something to control buffer access between CPU
and DMA? The below shows that:

        User(thread a)          User(thread b)            Kernel
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        send a src to driver---------------------------------->
                                                          update DMA register
        lock the src
                                request DMA start(1)---------->
        CPU acccess to src
        unlock the src                                    lock src and dst
                                                          DMA start
                <-------------completion signal(2)-------------
        lock dst                                          DMA completion
        CPU access to dst                                 unlock src and dst
        unlock DST

        (1) Try to start DMA operation while CPU is accessing the src buffer.
        (2) Try CPU access to dst buffer while DMA is accessing the dst buffer.

	In the same way, we could reduce hand shaking overhead between
	two processes when those processes need to share a shared buffer.
	There may be other cases that we could reduce overhead as well.


Basic concept
-------------

The mechanism of this framework has the following steps,
    1. Register dmabufs to a sync object - A task gets a new sync object and
    can add one or more dmabufs that the task wants to access.
    This registering should be performed when a device context or an event
    context such as a page flip event is created or before CPU accesses a shared
    buffer.

	dma_buf_sync_get(a sync object, a dmabuf);

    2. Lock a sync object - A task tries to lock all dmabufs added in its own
    sync object. Basically, the lock mechanism uses ww-mutexes[2] to avoid dead
    lock issue and for race condition between CPU and CPU, CPU and DMA, and DMA
    and DMA. Taking a lock means that others cannot access all locked dmabufs
    until the task that locked the corresponding dmabufs, unlocks all the locked
    dmabufs.
    This locking should be performed before DMA or CPU accesses these dmabufs.

	dma_buf_sync_lock(a sync object);

    3. Unlock a sync object - The task unlocks all dmabufs added in its own sync
    object. The unlock means that the DMA or CPU accesses to the dmabufs have
    been completed so that others may access them.
    This unlocking should be performed after DMA or CPU has completed accesses
    to the dmabufs.

	dma_buf_sync_unlock(a sync object);

    4. Unregister one or all dmabufs from a sync object - A task unregisters
    the given dmabufs from the sync object. This means that the task dosen't
    want to lock the dmabufs.
    The unregistering should be performed after DMA or CPU has completed
    accesses to the dmabufs or when dma_buf_sync_lock() is failed.

	dma_buf_sync_put(a sync object, a dmabuf);
	dma_buf_sync_put_all(a sync object);

    The described steps may be summarized as:
	get -> lock -> CPU or DMA access to a buffer/s -> unlock -> put

This framework includes the following two features.
    1. read (shared) and write (exclusive) locks - A task is required to declare
    the access type when the task tries to register a dmabuf;
    READ, WRITE, READ DMA, or WRITE DMA.

    The below is example codes,
	struct dmabuf_sync *sync;

	sync = dmabuf_sync_init(NULL, "test sync");

	dmabuf_sync_get(sync, dmabuf, DMA_BUF_ACCESS_R);
	...

    2. Mandatory resource releasing - a task cannot hold a lock indefinitely.
    A task may never try to unlock a buffer after taking a lock to the buffer.
    In this case, a timer handler to the corresponding sync object is called
    in five (default) seconds and then the timed-out buffer is unlocked by work
    queue handler to avoid lockups and to enforce resources of the buffer.


Access types
------------

DMA_BUF_ACCESS_R - CPU will access a buffer for read.
DMA_BUF_ACCESS_W - CPU will access a buffer for read or write.
DMA_BUF_ACCESS_DMA_R - DMA will access a buffer for read
DMA_BUF_ACCESS_DMA_W - DMA will access a buffer for read or write.


Generic user interfaces
-----------------------

And this framework includes fcntl system call[3] as interfaces exported
to user. As you know, user sees a buffer object as a dma-buf file descriptor.
So fcntl() call with the file descriptor means to lock some buffer region being
managed by the dma-buf object.


API set
-------

bool is_dmabuf_sync_supported(void)
	- Check if dmabuf sync is supported or not.

struct dmabuf_sync *dmabuf_sync_init(void *priv, const char *name)
	- Allocate and initialize a new sync object. The caller can get a new
	sync object for buffer synchronization. priv is used to set caller's
	private data and name is the name of sync object.

void dmabuf_sync_fini(struct dmabuf_sync *sync)
	- Release all resources to the sync object.

int dmabuf_sync_get(struct dmabuf_sync *sync, void *sync_buf,
			unsigned int type)
	- Get dmabuf sync object. Internally, this function allocates
	a dmabuf_sync object and adds a given dmabuf to it, and also takes
	a reference to the dmabuf. The caller can tie up multiple dmabufs
	into one sync object by calling this function several times.

void dmabuf_sync_put(struct dmabuf_sync *sync, struct dma_buf *dmabuf)
	- Put dmabuf sync object to a given dmabuf. Internally, this function
	removes a given dmabuf from a sync object and remove the sync object.
	At this time, the dmabuf is putted.

void dmabuf_sync_put_all(struct dmabuf_sync *sync)
	- Put dmabuf sync object to dmabufs. Internally, this function removes
	all dmabufs from a sync object and remove the sync object.
	At this time, all dmabufs are putted.

int dmabuf_sync_lock(struct dmabuf_sync *sync)
	- Lock all dmabufs added in a sync object. The caller should call this
	function prior to CPU or DMA access to the dmabufs so that others can
	not access the dmabufs. Internally, this function avoids dead lock
	issue with ww-mutexes.

int dmabuf_sync_single_lock(struct dma_buf *dmabuf)
	- Lock a dmabuf. The caller should call this
	function prior to CPU or DMA access to the dmabuf so that others can
	not access the dmabuf.

int dmabuf_sync_unlock(struct dmabuf_sync *sync)
	- Unlock all dmabufs added in a sync object. The caller should call
	this function after CPU or DMA access to the dmabufs is completed so
	that others can access the dmabufs.

void dmabuf_sync_single_unlock(struct dma_buf *dmabuf)
	- Unlock a dmabuf. The caller should call this function after CPU or
	DMA access to the dmabuf is completed so that others can access
	the dmabuf.


Tutorial for device driver
--------------------------

1. Allocate and Initialize a sync object:
	struct dmabuf_sync *sync;

	sync = dmabuf_sync_init(NULL, "test sync");
	...

2. Add a dmabuf to the sync object when setting up dma buffer relevant registers:
	dmabuf_sync_get(sync, dmabuf, DMA_BUF_ACCESS_READ);
	...

3. Lock all dmabufs of the sync object before DMA or CPU accesses the dmabufs:
	dmabuf_sync_lock(sync);
	...

4. Now CPU or DMA can access all dmabufs locked in step 3.

5. Unlock all dmabufs added in a sync object after DMA or CPU access to these
   dmabufs is completed:
	dmabuf_sync_unlock(sync);

   And call the following functions to release all resources,
	dmabuf_sync_put_all(sync);
	dmabuf_sync_fini(sync);


Tutorial for user application
-----------------------------
	struct flock filelock;

1. Lock a dma buf:
	filelock.l_type = F_WRLCK or F_RDLCK;

	/* lock entire region to the dma buf. */
	filelock.lwhence = SEEK_CUR;
	filelock.l_start = 0;
	filelock.l_len = 0;

	fcntl(dmabuf fd, F_SETLKW or F_SETLK, &filelock);
	...
	CPU access to the dma buf

2. Unlock a dma buf:
	filelock.l_type = F_UNLCK;

	fcntl(dmabuf fd, F_SETLKW or F_SETLK, &filelock);

	close(dmabuf fd) call would also unlock the dma buf. And for more
	detail, please refer to [3]
